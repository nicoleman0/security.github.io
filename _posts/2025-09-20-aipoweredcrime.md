### **Shadow Alliances: How Criminal Networks Work with State Actors**

*By Nicholas Coleman*

Over the past few years, the convergence of state actors and organized crime has taken an alarming turn. Across the globe, criminal networks now act as proxies for governments such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, carrying out cyberattacks, sabotage, data theft, and disinformation campaigns. While states have long recruited individuals from the criminal underworld, what we see today is something worryingly different: active, mutual cooperation between organized criminal groups and government agencies.

At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence has lowered the barriers to entry for cybercrime. AI has become a force multiplier for hybrid attacks, enabling criminals and hostile states to conduct operations at scale with unprecedented speed, precision, and impact.

### **The Logic of Shadow Alliances**

These partnerships benefit both sides. Criminal organizations gain protection, resources, and legitimacy, while states exploit the networks’ expertise and infrastructure to obscure their own involvement. By adopting the Crime-as-a-Service (CaaS) model, criminal groups have positioned themselves as service providers for state clients. The result is a new kind of coalition that allows governments to pursue aggressive hybrid operations while maintaining plausible deniability.

The implications are profound. These “shadow alliances” threaten not only democratic institutions but also the cohesion of society itself. Trust in the rule of law, the stability of public services, and even the basic sense of security in Western democracies are all eroding under the weight of this new threat.

### **The Woodpecker Strategy**

Europol describes these proxy groups as operating with a “woodpecker modus operandi.” Instead of overwhelming, one-off strikes, they launch repeated, smaller-scale attacks that gradually weaken institutions over time—whether by sabotaging water supplies, hacking hospitals, or disrupting energy infrastructure. What may look like isolated incidents often turn out to be coordinated campaigns designed to destabilize entire societies.

As EU Commissioner Magnus Brunner has warned, “Criminal networks that work on behalf of foreign powers—that is something new.” These networks provide states with connections, smuggling routes, and tactics that extend their reach and amplify their impact. By attacking in persistent, low-level waves, they chip away at public trust and democratic stability in ways that large-scale operations often cannot.

### **AI as a Game-Changer**

Generative AI has completely transformed the cybercrime landscape. Deepfakes, voice cloning, and synthetic media now fuel fraud, extortion, and disinformation at a scale unimaginable only a few years ago. AI-powered phishing and malware allow criminals to craft convincing, highly tailored attacks with minimal technical knowledge. Anyone with an internet connection and basic familiarity with AI tools can impersonate someone’s voice, generate false identities, or create a spear-phishing campaign.

The applications are virtually limitless—and criminals know it. Europol Executive Director Catherine De Bolle has warned that “AI-driven attacks are becoming more precise and devastating.” By blending profit motives with state-aligned ideological goals, these hybrid operations blur the lines between crime, politics, and warfare.

States like North Korea have already embraced these tactics, using AI-enabled fraud schemes and illicit cryptocurrency operations to generate revenue. With AI-driven mixers and tumblers, laundering stolen funds has become faster, simpler, and harder to trace than ever.

### **The Growing Urgency for Countermeasures**

Europe now faces near-daily hybrid threats. Russia, in particular, has escalated its cyber operations, with the Netherlands recently experiencing its first case of Russian cyber sabotage against public services. Western states must adapt by developing better defenses against “woodpecker” campaigns and training officials to detect AI-generated content designed to deceive.

Critical sectors—healthcare, banking, energy, and defense—require immediate protection, while international cooperation must focus on dismantling the criminal groups enabling these states. Extraditions, sanctions, and targeted crackdowns remain vital tools, especially when states outsource operations to groups in regions more amenable to Western cooperation. For instance, North Korea may hire networks in Southeast Asia to conduct operations on its behalf, exploiting jurisdictions where Western countries can still intervene.

The stakes could not be higher. If left unchecked, these shadow alliances risk normalizing hybrid crime-warfare, undermining democracy, destabilizing societies, and accelerating the collapse of trust in the institutions that hold them together.
